        I love digital everything.
    <br></br> 
        I like how we can duplicate a copy of everything from the real world to digital world.
        And likewise everything from the digital world to real world.
        Thank you x, y, z axis.
        <br></br> 
        I like everything free, if possible, especially the education. 
        Thank you accessible information sources, university datases, udemy classes And
        a special thanks to random people who are willing to share their knowledge!
        <br></br> 
        I will be using this page to update my cv and thoughts through blogs and with recent links to other projects or collections i am working on.
        <br></br> 
    I love how it connects academia world wide.
    I love how it helps preserving cultural and natural heritage and giving access to them people worldwide.
    <br></br> 
    I love how I can read, listen and see about peoples thoughts and discussions about any subject on social media platforms
    <br></br> 
    Even though there are many negativities
 
        Hopefully it has many updates.
        Maşallah!
