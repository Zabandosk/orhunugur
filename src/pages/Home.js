Welcome, User! 
<br />
Thank you for visiting my site. 
<br />
I see this space as a small shop in the vast village of the internet, surrounded by large shopping malls run by big companies. This is a cozy place where you can sit, have some tea or coffee, relax, and look around. It’s a piece of heritage I want to build with my hands and hopefully preserve for the future, although I’m not sure where it will lead. 
<br />
I created this site for various reasons. 
<br />
This is a space that I can share things and thoughts online with the visitors who wants to listen. No need to be seen once in your favourite social media when you refresh, no need any algorith to push me infront of you. and I am also social media shy. Instead of sharing there, I have this space to publish my thoughts. <a href='/clog'>Captain's log</a> is where I hope to do this.
<br />
I also want to use this space as a testing platform. I’m a self-taught developer, which means I sometimes break things as I learn. Of course, I need an online space to test what I work on locally. So, you might see bugs from time to time! In those moments, I’ll say what I always tell myself: “Don’t panic.”
<br />
This site is also a place to showcase my other projects. I love learning by practicing. For instance, my biggest passion these days is to develop my own heritage platform. I’m currently working on <a href='/diy-heritage'>DIY-Heritage</a> and thinking of adding new projects here over time.
<br />
Finally, I hope this space will lead to new conversations and potential collaborations. I’m very open to any feedback about the website or its content, and I’m also open to job opportunities. Feel free to reach out if you have something to share!
