<p> 
Welcome User! 
<br></br>
Thanks for visiting my site. I have created this site to various reasons.
<br></br>
First of all, i see this place as a shop in the massive village of internet, in the middle of massive shopping malls running by big companies. 
This is a small shop, where you can sit and drink your tea or coffee while sitting on a chair an look around.
A heritage i want to build with my hands, hopefully preserve for future, i dont know how its going to be.
<br></br>
i want to write things and shared online with the world. i am a shy social media user. instead of them i have my own space to publish my thoughts.
i want to use the <a href='/blog'>blog page</a> for this reason. 
<br></br>
i want to use this space for online testing platform. i am a self taught-developer. thus i make break a lot during my learning process.
and of course i need a online space to test what i test (yes, lots of tests) in my local environment. it is possible to see bugs from time to time. in this cases i would tell you what i always tell to myself 
'dont panic'. 
<br></br>
i want to use this place to link my other projects. i love learning by practising. e.g. my biggest passion these days is to develop my own heritage platform.
i am developing my <a href='/diy-heritage'>DIY-Heritage</a> website. hopefully im thinking about new projects to add here.
<br></br>
I wish this space to create new conversations and possible collabration with people. I am very open for any thoughts about the website or any of the content within. 
I am also open for job positions
Reach me out if you have anything to say!
