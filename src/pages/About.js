<p>
I am Orhun UÄŸur, someone who tries to bring order to the chaos of information.
</p>
<p>
I am a digital archaeologist and archivist with an interdisciplinary background in archaeology (BA) and information management (MA). I like digging the information of the past and today, and preserving it for the future.
</p>
<p>
I value heritage in all its forms and types. If something is recognized as heritage by anyone, I also acknowledge its significance and aim to help safeguard it.
</p>
<p>
I strongly support openness, participation, and DIY approaches in every part of life, especially in heritage management. Heritage is too important to be left entirely in the hands of authorities.
</p>
<p>
I love learning new things and putting them into practice. Life is limited, so much to explore, curiosity is the key. Sounds like a cool motto, aye? 
</p>
<p>
Finally, I want to close by thanking digital technologies. Thank you, spreadsheets, for making information easier to manage. Thank you, x, y, and z axes, for enabling us to create virtual copies of real-world objects and vice versa. Thank you, www, for connecting everyone and everything. And thanks to the countless tools and software that help us along the way.
